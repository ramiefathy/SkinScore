  description: "The Psoriasis Epidemiology Screening Tool (PEST) was developed to address the underdiagnosis of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) among patients with psoriasis, particularly in non-rheumatology settings.",
  condition: "Psoriasis / Psoriatic Arthritis",
  keywords: ["pest", "psoriasis", "psoriatic arthritis", "screening", "questionnaire", "arthritis", "nail pitting"],
  sourceType: 'Research',
  icon: ClipboardList,
  rationale: "The tool was designed to be simple, rapid, and feasible for use by dermatologists and primary care providers to identify patients who may require rheumatologic evaluation. The PEST consists of five yes/no questions and a manikin diagram for patients to indicate joint involvement. Each \"yes\" response on the PEST scores 1 point, for a total possible score of 0 to 5. A score of â‰¥3 is considered suggestive of PsA and warrants further rheumatologic assessment.",
  clinicalPerformance: "The PEST has demonstrated high sensitivity and moderate specificity. In its original development, sensitivity was 0.94 and specificity was 0.78. Validation studies in Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese cohorts reported sensitivities of 93.1% and 84.6%, and specificities of 78.9% and 63.3%, respectively. In a pediatric pilot study, the PEST achieved 100% sensitivity and specificity, outperforming the Early Arthritis for Psoriatic Patients (EARP) questionnaire. In primary care, the PEST had a sensitivity of 0.68 and specificity of 0.71, again outperforming PASE and EARP in balanced accuracy. Comparative studies have shown that the PEST, PASQ, and ToPAS are all useful for screening, with the PEST offering a favorable trade-off between sensitivity and specificity.\n\n**Real-World Implementation:**\nThe PEST is widely used in dermatology clinics and is increasingly being integrated into electronic health record (EHR) systems to enable automated screening. This integration has been shown to increase clinician adoption and sustained use with minimal impact on visit duration. The PEST is brief, easy to administer, and correlates with patient-reported quality of life, as higher PEST scores are associated with lower Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) scores. Barriers include the potential for over-referral and the need for standardized follow-up protocols.",
