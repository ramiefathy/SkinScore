  description: "The PGA is a clinician-rated, static global assessment of psoriasis severity, designed to provide a rapid, standardized evaluation of overall disease severity. The rationale for its development was to offer a simple alternative or complement to more complex tools such as the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI), particularly for use in clinical trials and routine practice. The PGA is typically structured as a 5- or 6-point ordinal scale, with categories such as \"clear,\" \"almost clear,\" \"mild,\" \"moderate,\" and \"severe.\" The assessment is based on the average severity of erythema, induration, and scaling across all involved body areas. The physician assigns a single score reflecting overall severity, without formal subscores. Composite measures, such as the product of PGA and body surface area (PGA Ã— BSA), have been introduced to enhance sensitivity, especially in mild disease.",
